![](photo.png)

## Introduction

Managing inventory and tracking sales are vital to the smooth operation of any retail business. 
This Excel template provides a streamlined, beginner-friendly tool for recording sales transactions and purchases, calculating stock levels, and generating inventory summaries, all using Excelâ€™s built-in functions and logic.

## Problem Statement

Most small businesses donâ€™t have the time, budget, or interest to learn inventory management software.  
Additionally, poor tracking can lead to stockouts, over-ordering, and missed sales opportunities.

I built this template to solve that, using only Excel.

## What This Template Helps You Do

- Log and organize sales + restocks across multiple products  
- Automatically update current stock levels  
- Quickly see low/out-of-stock products  
- Keep everything tidy and in one place


## Skills Demonstrated

- Advanced Excel formula design (`SUMIFS`, `IFERROR`, `LOOKUP`, `MAX`, `COUNTIF`)  
- Table structuring and data normalization  
- Dynamic referencing and cross-sheet automation  
- Clean layout design for usability and scalability
